# stdiff

Here we develop the diffing primitives for the universe 
of regular types.

The goal of this experiment is to have a stable and relatively simple model
where we can study conflict resolution before porting our ideas
to the universe of Regular Tree Types.

# Agda Versions

The development is made on Agda 2.5.2 and standard library 0.13
